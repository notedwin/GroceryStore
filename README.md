# Grocery Store

Grocery Store is a online grocery store powered by Django Python Framework.

This project was initially made for CS425: Database Organization at [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu/)

### Features
- User Creation and User Authentication
- Payement through [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/)


### Getting Started
Linux:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cs425-groceryStore/manage.py runserver

or cd into cs425-groceryStore 
python manage.py runserver

you are likely to get an Error related to the private key for Stripe. You can get your own from stripe if you want to test it locally.
